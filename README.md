# vWires
Virtual Wiring to test Ethernet and Serial networks

# Intent
* vWires library can be linked to any application, and if two or more applications are run on the same PC, they will be able to connect to each other over the Virtual Wiring
* A single application can connect internally between threads
* RS-485 multidrop (half duplex) fully emulated
* Injection of noise, dropouts, fuzzing possible
* 'Controller' program can modify on the fly
* Console, command line or UI driven
* Real-time, slow and instantaneous modes for e.g. regression testing quickly, singlestepping/debugging complex protocols
* Named wires
* Thousands of instances of wires and applications possible
